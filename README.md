# **!!!!!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!!**
If you want to update lunar client just launch the normal lunar client and then open Monar, that will update your lunar client

Also if you have installed LCProxy (one of our addonds) please uninstall it if you are going to use the normal lunar client or just update the client.
this is for skip any problem that lunar client can create with lcproxy files.




Also, Monar stills needing the original LC Launcher for get Lunar Client Updated, so this isnt a replacement of the real launcher,
its just an alternative for a """optimized""" launcher, and it has some settings & addon's.
