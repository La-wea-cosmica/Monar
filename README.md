Now you can use Monar Witeout Any Problems! (if you have problems please go to https://dsc.gg/lunarcosmetics and tell us our problem.)
# **!!!!!!!!!! WARNING !!!!!!!!!!**
If you want to update lunar client just launch the normal lunar client and then open Monar, that will update your lunar client

Also if you have installed LCProxy (one of our addonds) please uninstall it if you are going to use the normal lunar client or just update the client.
this is for skip any problem that lunar client can create with lcproxy files.







Also, Monar stills needing the original lunar client launcher, so this isnt a replacement of the real launcher,
its just a """optimized""" launcher, and it has some addon's
